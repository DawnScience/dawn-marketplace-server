It is self-contained, so there is no need to install anything for deployment except for Java 8. While it is created for serving [DAWN](http://www.dawnsci.org) plug-ins, it can be used for distributing plug-ins for any Eclipse based product as it is compatible with the [Eclipse Marketplace client](https://www.eclipse.org/mpc/).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Starting the server\r\n\r\nWhen running the standalone server you need to start it from the command line. E.g. `java -jar org.dawnsci.marketplace.server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war --init`.\r\n\r\nSee the [notes for the server](org.dawnsci.marketplace.server/README.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Using the marketplace client\r\n\r\nStart Eclipse with required parameters for connecting to the server, e.g. `/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse -vmargs -Dorg.eclipse.epp.internal.mpc.core.service.DefaultMarketplaceService.url=http://localhost:8080/mpc -Dorg.eclipse.epp.internal.mpc.core.service.DefaultCatalogService.url=http://localhost:8080/mpc`\r\n\r\nReplace http://localhost:8080 with whatever you have the server running on.\r\n\r\n## Development and Building\r\n\r\nWhen doing development on this code, you should start the server from within Eclipse. That will allow you to do normal debugging. Make sure the [Spring tool suite](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-ide) is installed and launch the __org.dawnsci.marketplace.server__ project as a _Spring Boot App_. Add `--init` to create an initial data set for testing.\r\n\r\nThe server is built using Maven so it is sufficient to execute `mvn clean package` from the project root.\r\n",
