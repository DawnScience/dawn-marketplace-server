It is self-contained, so there is no need to install anything for deployment except for Java 8. While it is created for serving [DAWN](http://www.dawnsci.org) plug-ins, it can be used for distributing plug-ins for any Eclipse based product as it is compatible with the [Eclipse Marketplace client](https://www.eclipse.org/mpc/).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q9q4DZT.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"/>\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8MDOIJQ.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"/>",
