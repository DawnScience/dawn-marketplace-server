### Welcome to the DAWN Marketplace

The DAWN Marketplace provides a list of plugins that can be installed in a DAWN instance in order to make it have more features and capabilities.

The marketplace also enables DAWN users, if they wish to , to share with the wider DAWN community their plugins (that might have been developed in DAWN) by uploading those plugins to the DAWN marketplace.

The listings allow each solution provider to specify a P2 repository for their solution. DAWN users now have a central catalog to find DAWN solutions but the install process is still not tightly integrated with the Eclipse workspace.

The installation of plugins available in the DAWN marketplace can be done using the Market Place Client (MPC) which provides the tight install integration between the DAWN workspace and DAWN Marketplace.
